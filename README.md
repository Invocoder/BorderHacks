Online testing of certain conditions so that they don’t have to go to hospital - ex. Online Parkinson’s test (there’s some data on typing speed, etc. for parkinson’s patients), online vision test, cognitive test, etc. Would be useful for progressive conditions like dementia, parkinson’s, muscular dystrophy, etc. because they get worse over time
Dementia and parkinson’s in particular would be interesting since they are generally in older people who would be more susceptible to COVID and it would be better for them to stay out of hospital.
